I used to have a blog in [Wordpress](https://alvinabad.wordpress.com/). But hey, Github is the new craze, right?

It is probably unlikely that you'll learn new things from this blog. Most information is already available out there. 
My main motivation for doing this is to document the things that I have learned. 
I've been in my profession for more than two decades now and I've noticed that overtime I tend to forget what I did a long time ago.
But if you learned something new from this blog, then that's good. I'm glad I was able to help.

You can look me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alvinabad/) to find out more about me.
